# S0SIM

A small horse-race program I wrote in Turbo Pascal in my 8th grade.
It was accompanied by a small README file with a cryptic note:

```
Shalom avi
ine program azbani im s0sim
run it,
try 10 hazir 50 kashe
ok ?


bye,
uri.
```

Unlike most of the code I wrote back then, [the source code](source/S0SIM.PAS) seems fairly 
documented. Perhaps too much...
